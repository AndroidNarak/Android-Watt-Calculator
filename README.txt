Purpose:
Enter the wattage of a device/appliance, and find out how much it will cost you.

Justification:
I was searching for an app/web page that did this, found a few, but they all lacked a
key feature: YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR KW/H RATE IS. I didn't want a perfect cost
calculation... just an estimate, and I don't carry my electricity bill around with
me. Average kw/h information by state is published yearly by the US gov and freely
available. Allowing the user to default to average rates for their state should 
improve usability for this class of application. The user can always enter their exact
rate should they care.

Additionally I need an excuse to learn about the Android Platform.

TODO
  [X] incorporate the average rates and a state selector
  [X] make text entry more usable, eliminate 'calculate' button
  [X] clean up the layout
  [X] make it pretty
  [ ] find/make an icon
  [ ] get it signed and figure out how to put it in the Android Marketplace
