Here are some notes for setting up the android sdk on linux:

install stuff:
  * android sdk
  * sun java 6 (openjdk will fail miserably in subtle ways)
  * ant
  * add to the $PATH two directories from android sdk install location:
    * tools
    * platform-tools

create the avd (android virtual device)
 * run 'android'
 * create the avd from the menu option
 * start the emulator: emulator -avd NexusOne

build and deploy the project
 * 'ant debug'
 * 'adb [-d] install -r bin/Android-Hello-debug.apk'
   * -d option will install to phone over usb connection
